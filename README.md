*DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION*:The E-Learning Platform UI is a front-end web application designed to provide a structured, interactive, and user-friendly digital learning environment. The main purpose of this platform is to allow users to browse courses, watch educational video content, and track their learning progress visually. With the increasing demand for online education, such platforms are widely used by educational institutions, training organizations, corporate learning systems, and individual learners.

This application includes key features such as a course listing page, course player with video embedding, and progress tracking system. The course listing page displays available courses in an organized card-based layout, making it easy for users to explore different learning options. The course player page embeds videos using external sources, enabling learners to watch lessons directly within the platform. Progress tracking is implemented using visual progress bars, which help users understand how much of the course they have completed. This feature increases motivation and encourages consistent learning.

The platform is designed to be interactive and easy to use, even for beginners. Navigation between pages is simple and smooth, allowing users to move between the dashboard, course list, and course player without confusion. The interface is responsive, meaning it adapts well to different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This ensures accessibility and convenience for users across various devices.

The E-Learning Platform UI is built using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the content, including navigation bars, course cards, video sections, and progress indicators. CSS is used to style the interface, manage layouts, add responsiveness, and create a visually appealing design. JavaScript is used to handle interactivity, course selection, video loading, and progress tracking using browser localStorage. Since the project is front-end focused, no backend server is required, making it easy to understand and maintain.

The main references used for this project include MDN Web Docs for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and browser APIs, W3Schools for understanding syntax and examples, and online UI/UX design references for layout inspiration. Overall, this project helps learners understand how modern e-learning systems work and provides hands-on experience in building real-world user interfaces for educational platforms.
